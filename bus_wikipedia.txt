A bus (/ˈbʌs/; plural "buses", /ˈbʌsɨz/, archaically also omnibus, multibus, or autobus) is a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers. Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers.[1] The most common type of bus is the single-decker rigid bus, with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses; coaches are used for longer-distance services. Bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised, with the same design appearing around the world.
