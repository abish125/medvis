Boasting or bragging is the act of making an ostentatious speech.[1] It is considered a vice by major religious groups such as Islam,[2] Hinduism,[3] and Buddhism.[4] Boasting has also been studied by such evolutionary psychologists as Robert Wright,[5] and can involve magnifying an accomplishment out of proportion to its importance.[6]
