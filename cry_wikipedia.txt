Crying is the shedding of tears in response to an emotional state in humans. The act of crying has been defined as "a complex secretomotor phenomenon characterized by the shedding of tears from the lacrimal apparatus, without any irritation of the ocular structures".[1] A related medical term is lacrimation, which also refers to non-emotional shedding of tears. Crying is also known as sobbing, weeping, wailing, whimpering, bawling, and blubbering.[2]
