Bupropion is a medication primarily used as an antidepressant and smoking cessation aid.[6][7][8] It is marketed as Wellbutrin and Zyban among other trade names. It is one of the most frequently prescribed antidepressants in the United States and Canada,[9] although in many countries this is an off-label use.[10] It is an effective antidepressant on its own, but is also popular as an add-on medication in cases of incomplete response to first-line SSRI antidepressants.[11] Bupropion is taken in tablet form and is available only by prescription in most countries.[9]
