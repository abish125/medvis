Metformin, marketed under the tradename Glucophage among others, is the first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.[3][4] This is particularly true in people who are overweight.[5] It is also used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome.[3] Limited evidence suggests metformin may prevent the cardiovascular disease and cancer complications of diabetes.[6][7] It is not associated with weight gain.[7] It is taken by mouth.[3]
