Escitalopram, also known by the brand names Lexapro and Cipralex among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults and children over 12 years of age with major depressive disorder (MDD) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Escitalopram is the (S)-stereoisomer (Left-enantiomer) of the earlier Lundbeck drug citalopram, hence the name escitalopram. Whether escitalopram exhibits superior therapeutic properties to citalopram or merely represents an example of "evergreening" is controversial.[2]
