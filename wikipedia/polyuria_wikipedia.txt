Polyuria (/ˌpɒliˈjʊəriə/) is a condition usually defined as excessive or abnormally large production or passage of urine (greater than 2.5[1] or 3[2] L over 24 hours in adults). Frequent urination is sometimes included by definition but is nonetheless usually an accompanying symptom. Increased production and passage of urine may also be termed diuresis.[3][4] Polyuria often appears in conjunction with polydipsia (increased thirst), though it is possible to have one without the other, and the latter may be a cause or an effect. Psychogenic polydipsia may lead to polyuria. [5] Polyuria is usually viewed as a symptom or sign of another disorder (not a disease by itself), but it can be classed as a disorder, at least when its underlying causes are not clear.[citation needed]
