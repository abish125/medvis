A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system consisting of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas and dust, and dark matter.[1][2] The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way. Examples of galaxies range from dwarfs with just a few thousand (103) stars to giants with one hundred trillion (1014) stars,[3] each orbiting their galaxy's own center of mass. Galaxies have historically been categorized according to their visual morphology, including elliptical,[4] spiral, irregular,[5] and starburst. Many galaxies are believed to have black holes at their active center. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times that of our Sun.[6]
