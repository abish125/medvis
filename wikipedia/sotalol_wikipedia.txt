Sotalol is a drug used in individuals with rhythm disturbances of the heart (cardiac arrhythmias). It is a non-selective competitive beta-adrenergic receptor blocker that also exhibits Class III antiarrhythmic properties.[2][3] Originally discovered in 1960, sotalol became widely used first as a beta blocker in the 1980s, and its function as an antiarrhythmic drug was discovered soon after.[4] Due to the dual action of sotalol, it is often used preferentially to other beta blockers as treatment for both ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.[2][5]
