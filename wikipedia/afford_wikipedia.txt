An affordance is often taken as a relation between an object or an environment and an organism, that affords the opportunity for that organism to perform an action.[1][2] For example, a knob affords twisting, and perhaps pushing, while a cord affords pulling. As a relation, an affordance exhibits the possibility of some action, and is not a property of either an organism or its environment alone.[3][4]
