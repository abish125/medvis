Myocardial infarction (MI; Latin: infarctus myocardii) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood stops flowing properly to a part of the heart, and the heart muscle is injured because it is not receiving enough oxygen. Usually, this is because one of the coronary arteries that supplies blood to the heart develops a blockage due to an unstable buildup of white blood cells, cholesterol and fat. The event is called "acute" if it is sudden and serious. Myocardial infarction differs from cardiac arrest, although cardiac arrest can be a consequence of MI.
