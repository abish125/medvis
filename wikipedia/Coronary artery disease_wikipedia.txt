Coronary artery disease (CAD) also known as atherosclerotic heart disease,[1] atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,[2] coronary heart disease,[3] or ischemic heart disease (IHD),[4] is the most common type of heart disease and cause of heart attacks.[5] The disease is caused by plaque building up along the inner walls of the arteries of the heart, which narrows the lumen of arteries and reduces blood flow to the heart.
