Disclose were a Japanese D-beat band from K≈çchi City, heavily influenced by Discharge. Their sound heavily replicates Discharge's style, with an increased use of fuzz and distortion guitar effects. The subject matter is also similar to Discharge, in that the songs' themes are primarily about nuclear war, and its horrific consequences. On June 5, 2007, Disclose frontman Kawakami died from an overdose of alcohol and sedative.[1]
