Dinner usually refers to the most significant, and important, meal of the day, which can be the noon or the evening meal. However, the term "dinner" can have many different meanings depending on the culture; it may mean a meal of any size eaten at any time of day.[1][2] Historically, it referred to the first meal of the day, eaten around noon, and is still sometimes used for a noontime meal, particularly if it is a large or main meal. However, the meaning as the evening meal, generally the largest of the day, is becoming standard in most parts of the English-speaking world. The average dinner time in the U.K. for those who call their evening meal dinner has been found to be at 7.47pm. [3]
