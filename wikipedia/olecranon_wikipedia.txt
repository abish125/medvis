The olecranon /oʊˈlɛkrənɒn/ from the Greek olene meaning elbow and kranon meaning head.[1] is a large, thick, curved bony eminence of a bone in the forearm (the ulna) that projects behind the elbow. It forms the most pointed portion of the elbow and is opposite to the cubital fossa. The olecranon serves as a lever for muscles that extend (straighten) the elbow joint.
