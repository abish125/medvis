Mirtazapine (originally branded Remeron, many generics)[1] is an atypical antidepressant with noradrenergic and specific serotonergic activity. It blocks the Î±2 adrenergic auto- and heteroreceptors (enhancing serotonin release), and selectively antagonizes the 5-HT2 serotonin receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system. It also enhances serotonin neurotransmission at the 5-HT1 receptor and blocks the histaminergic (H1) and muscarinic receptors. Mirtazapine is not a serotonin or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor but may increase serotonin and norepinephrine by other mechanisms of action.[7]
