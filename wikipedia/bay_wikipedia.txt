A bay is a body of water connected to an ocean or lake, formed by an indentation of the shoreline.[1] A large bay may be called a gulf, a sea, a sound, or a bight. A cove is a smaller circular or oval coastal inlet with a narrow entrance; some coves may be referred to as bays. A fjord is a particularly steep bay shaped by glacial activity.
