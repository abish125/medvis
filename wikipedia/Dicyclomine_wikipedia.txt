Dicycloverine, also known as dicyclomine, is a prescription medication that relieves muscle spasms in the gastrointestinal tract through an apparent mechanism of nonselective smooth muscle relaxation, and that presents a range of anticholinergic side effects. It was first synthesized in the United States circa 1947.
