Mometasone (INN, BAN), is a synthetic, steroidal glucocorticoid or corticosteroid that was never marketed.[1][2][3] The C17Î± furoate ester of mometasone, mometasone furoate, in contrast, has been marketed.[1][2][3] Mometasone furoate acts as a prodrug of mometasone.[4] In addition to its glucocorticoid activity, mometasone also has very potent progestogenic activity and acts as a partial agonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor.[5]
