Fiber (or fibre; from the Latin fibra[1]) is a natural or synthetic string or used as a component of composite materials, or, when matted into sheets, used to make products such as paper, papyrus, or felt.[2] Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene.
