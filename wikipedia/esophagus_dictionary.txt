Esophageal atresia is a disorder of the digestive system in which the esophagus does not develop properly. 
It was used to alleviate bleeding varicose veins in the esophagus. 
The food then goes through the esophagus into the stomach. 
Then you breath in and the air flow pulls the medicine back down in the esophagus where you swallow the rest. At the same time the neck ribs would have splayed outward, increasing the volume of the esophagus. It is a rare disorder that can be linked to cancers of the esophagus and throat. Baking soda is a time-honored approach to neutralizing stomach acid that has splashed into the esophagus and is causing heartburn. When the lower esophageal sphincter doesn't function properly, acid and food can reflux up from the stomach into the esophagus. After the esophagus is removed, a new conduit for foods and fluids must be created to replace the esophagus. The severity of heartburn does not necessarily indicate actual injury to the esophagus.
