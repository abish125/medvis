Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen or APAP, is a medication used to treat pain and fever.[10] It is typically used for mild to moderate pain.[10] There is poor evidence for fever relief in children.[11] It is often sold in combination with other ingredients such as in many cold medications.[10] In combination with opioid pain medication, paracetamol is used for more severe pain such as cancer pain and after surgery.[12] It is typically used either by mouth or rectally but is also available intravenously.[10][13] Effects last between two and four hours.[13]
