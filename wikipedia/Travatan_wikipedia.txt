Travoprost ophthalmic solution is a topical medication used for controlling the progression of glaucoma or ocular hypertension, by reducing intraocular pressure. It is a synthetic prostaglandin analog (or more specifically, an analog of prostaglandin F2Î±)[1][2] that works by increasing the outflow of aqueous fluid from the eyes.[3] It is also known by the brand names of Travatan and Travatan Z, manufactured by Alcon.
