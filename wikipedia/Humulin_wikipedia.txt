Insulin comes in a number of different types including short acting (such as regular insulin) and longer acting (such as NPH insulin). Insulin is used to treat a number of diseases including diabetes and its acute complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states.[3] It is also used along with glucose to treat high blood potassium levels.[3] Side effects may include: low blood sugar levels, skin reactions at the site of injection and low potassium levels among others.[3]
