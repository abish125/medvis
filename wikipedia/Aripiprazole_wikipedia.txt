Aripiprazole, sold under the brand name Abilify among others, is an atypical antipsychotic. It is recommended and primarily used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.[5] Other uses include as an add-on treatment in major depressive disorder, tic disorders, and irritability associated with autism.[6] According to a Cochrane review, evidence for the oral form in schizophrenia is not sufficient to determine effects on general functioning.[7] Additionally, because many people dropped out of the medication trials before they were completed, the overall strength of the conclusions is low.[7]
