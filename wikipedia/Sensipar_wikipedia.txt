Cinacalcet (INN) is a drug that acts as a calcimimetic (i.e. it mimics the action of calcium on tissues) by allosteric activation of the calcium-sensing receptor that is expressed in various human organ tissues (Van Wagenen et al. (2001), U.S. Pat. 6,211,244). It is sold by Amgen under the trade name Sensipar in North America and Australia and as Mimpara in Europe. Cinacalcet is used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism (elevated parathyroid hormone levels), a consequence of end-stage renal disease.[1] Cinacalcet is also indicated for the treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma.[2] Cinacalcet was FDA approved in March 2004,[3] and was the first allosteric G protein-coupled receptor modulator to enter the pharmaceutical market.[4] In 2014, cinacalcet was 76th out of the top 100 drugs in the list of largest selling pharmaceutical products.[citation needed]
