Mupirocin, sold under the brand name Bactroban among others, is an antibiotic useful against superficial skin infections such as impetigo or folliculitis.[1][2] It may also be used to get rid of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) when present in the nose without symptoms.[1] Due to concerns of developing resistance, use for greater than ten days is not recommended.[2] It is used as a cream or ointment applied to the skin.[1]
