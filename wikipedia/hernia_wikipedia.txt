A hernia is the exit of an organ, such as the bowel, through the wall of the cavity in which it normally resides.[1] Hernias come in a number of different types. Most commonly they involve the abdomen, specifically the groin.[2] Groin hernias are most common of the inguinal type but may also be femoral.[1] Other hernias include hiatus, incisional, and umbilical hernias.[2] Symptoms are present in about 66% of people with groin hernias. This may include pain or discomfort especially with coughing, exercise, or going to the toilet. Often it gets worse throughout the day and improves when lying down. A bulging area may occur that becomes larger when bearing down. Groin hernias occur more often on the right than left side. The main concern is strangulation, where the blood supply to part of the bowel is blocked. This usually produces severe pain and tenderness of the area.[1] Hiatus or hiatal hernias often result in heartburn but may also cause chest pain or pain with eating.[3]
