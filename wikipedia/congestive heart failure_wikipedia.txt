Heart failure (HF), often used to mean chronic heart failure (CHF), occurs when the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the needs of the body.[1][2][3] The terms congestive heart failure (CHF) or congestive cardiac failure (CCF) are often used interchangeably with chronic heart failure.[4] Signs and symptoms commonly include shortness of breath, excessive tiredness, and leg swelling.[5] The shortness of breath is usually worse with exercise, when lying down, and at night while sleeping.[5] There is often a limitation on the amount of exercise people can perform, even when well treated.[6]
