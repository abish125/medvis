Nifedipine, sold under the brand names Adalat among others, is a medication used to manage angina, high blood pressure, Raynaud's phenomenon, and premature labor.[1] It is one of the treatments of choice for Prinzmetal angina. It may be used to treat severe high blood pressure in pregnancy. Its use in preterm labor may allow more time for steroids to improve the baby's lungs and time to transfer the mother to a well qualified medical facility before delivery. Nifedipine is taken by mouth and comes in fast and slow release formulations.[1]
