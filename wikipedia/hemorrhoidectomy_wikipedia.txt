Hemorrhoids, also spelled haemorrhoids, are vascular structures in the anal canal.[3][4] In their normal state, they are cushions that help with stool control.[2] They become a disease when swollen or inflamed; the unqualified term "hemorrhoid" is often used to mean the disease.[4] The signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids depend on the type present.[5] Internal hemorrhoids usually present with painless, bright red rectal bleeding when defecating.[6][5] External hemorrhoids often result in pain and swelling in the area of the anus. If bleeding occurs it is usually darker.[5] Symptoms frequently get better after a few days.[6] A skin tag may remain after the healing of an external hemorrhoid.[5]
