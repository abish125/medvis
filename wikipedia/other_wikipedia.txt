The "Other" (or "Constitutive Other") is a concept of the identity of difference that is discussed within some works of Continental philosophy and in the social sciences, such as across the taxonomies of anthropology. The state or characteristic of "the other/Other" is "being different [from] or [alien to]" the identity of self or social identities.[1] As such, the "other/Other" is perceived as dissimilar or opposite to being "us" or the Same. The terms the "other", "Other" and "Otherness" refer to who and what is distinct or separate from the the Symbolic, the Real, aesthetic and/or political norm, from identity, and from the self. The "Constitutive Other," using Hegel's construct of "the relation of essential nature to outward manifestation [is a point-of-view of the binary nature of the essential and the superficial where each is the inversion of each other] in pure change, ... to infinity, [where the difference], as inner difference, ... [is within] its own self.[2][3] When used as a verb it means to distinguish then label then identify as belonging to a category and then exclude those who do not fit a societal norm. In geographic terms "to other" means to place outside of the center, somewhere along the margins where the societal norm does not reside.[4]
