The urinary bladder is a hollow muscular organ that collects urine from the kidneys before disposal by urination. A hollow[1] muscular, and distensible (or elastic) organ, the bladder sits on the pelvic floor. Urine enters the bladder via the ureters and exits via the urethra. The typical human bladder capacity is between 300 and 500 mL (10.14 and 16.91 fl oz).[2][3]
