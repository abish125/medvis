Lorazepam, sold under the brand name Ativan among others, is a benzodiazepine medication.[2] It is used to treat anxiety disorders, trouble sleeping, active seizures including status epilepticus, for surgery to interfere with memory formation, sedate those who are being mechanically ventilated, alcohol withdrawal, and chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting.[2][6] While it can be used for severe agitation, midazolam is usually preferred. It is also used, along with other treatments, for acute coronary syndrome due to cocaine use. It can be given by mouth or as an injection into a muscle or vein. When given by injection onset of effects is between one and thirty minutes and effects last for up to a day.[2]
