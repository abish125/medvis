A rumor or rumour (see spelling differences) is "a tall tale of explanations of events circulating from person to person and pertaining to an object, event, or issue in public concern".[1] However, a review of the research on rumor conducted by Pendleton in 1998 found that research across sociology, psychology, and communication studies had widely varying definitions of rumor.[2]
