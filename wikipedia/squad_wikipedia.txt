In military terminology, a squad is a small sub-unit or minor unit led by a non-commissioned officer[1] that is subordinate to an infantry platoon. In countries following the British Army tradition (Australian Army, Canadian Army, and others), this organization is referred to as a section. In most armies, a squad consists of eight to fourteen soldiers,[2] and may be further subdivided into fireteams.
