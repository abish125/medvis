Fever, also known as pyrexia and febrile response,[1] is defined as having a temperature above the normal range due to an increase in the body's temperature set-point.[2][3] There is not a single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between 37.5 and 38.3 °C (99.5 and 100.9 °F).[1][4] The increase in set-point triggers increased muscle contraction and causes a feeling of cold.[5] This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat.[6] When the set-point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes flushed, and may begin to sweat.[6] Rarely a fever may trigger a febrile seizure. This is more common in young children.[7] Fevers do not typically go higher than 41 to 42 °C (105.8 to 107.6 °F).[3]
