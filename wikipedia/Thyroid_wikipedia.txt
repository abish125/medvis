The thyroid gland, or simply the thyroid /ˈθaɪrɔɪd/, is an endocrine gland in the neck, and consists of two lobes connected by an isthmus. It is found at the front of the neck, below the Adam's apple. The thyroid gland secretes thyroid hormones, which primarily influence the metabolic rate and protein synthesis. The hormones also have many other effects including those on development. The thyroid hormones T3 and T4 are synthesized from iodine and tyrosine. The thyroid also produces the hormone calcitonin, which plays a role in calcium homeostasis.[1]
