Mrs. (American English) or Mrs (British English) (Standard English pronunciation /ˈmɪsɨz/) is a commonly used English honorific used for women, usually for those who are married and who do not instead use another title (or rank), such as Dr, Professor, Lady, Dame, Baroness, etc. In most Commonwealth countries, a full stop (period) is not used with the title. In the United States and Canada a period is used (see Abbreviation).[citation needed]
