Carisoprodol, marketed under the brand name Soma among others, is a prescription drug marketed since 1959. It is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant of the carbamate class and produces all the effects associated with barbiturates. It is a prodrug[2] and is both structurally and pharmacologically related to meprobamate. The major metabolic pathway of carisoprodol involves its conversion to meprobamate, a barbiturate-like drug.[3]
