Sofosbuvir, sold under the brand name Sovaldi, is a medication used in combination with other medications for the treatment of hepatitis C.[2] Compared to previous treatments, sofosbuvir-based treatments provide a higher cure rate, fewer side effects, and a length of therapy that is two- to four-times shorter.[3] Sofosbuvir allows most people to be treated successfully without the use of peginterferon, an injectable drug with severe side effects that is a key component of older drug combinations for the treatment of hepatitis C virus.[4] Sofosbuvir by itself appears to be safe to take during pregnancy but medications used in combination are not.[5]
