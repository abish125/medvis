Statins (or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are a class of drugs used to lower cholesterol levels by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a central role in the production of cholesterol in the liver, which produces about 70 percent of total cholesterol in the body. High cholesterol levels have been associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD).[1] Statins have been found to prevent cardiovascular disease and mortality in those who are at high risk. The evidence is strong that statins are effective for treating CVD in the early stages of a disease (secondary prevention) and in those at elevated risk but without CVD (primary prevention).[2][3] Side effects of statins include muscle pain, increased risk of diabetes mellitus and abnormalities in liver enzyme tests.[4] Additionally, they have rare but severe adverse effects, particularly muscle damage.[5]
