Oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid synthesized from thebaine, an opioid alkaloid found in the Persian poppy, and one of the many alkaloids found in the opium poppy. It is a moderately potent opioid analgesic, generally indicated for relief of moderate to severe pain.[8] Oxycodone was developed in 1917 in Germany[9][10] as one of several semi-synthetic opioids in an attempt to improve on the existing opioids.[1]
