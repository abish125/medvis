Folic acid, another form of which is known as folate, is one of the B vitamins.[1] It is used as a supplement by women to prevent neural tube defects (NTDs) developing during pregnancy. It is also used to treat anemia caused by folic acid deficiency.[1] More than 50 countries require fortification of certain foods with folic acid as a measure to decrease the rate of NTDs in the population.[6][7] Long term supplementation is also associated with small reductions in the risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease.[8] It may be taken by mouth or by injection.[1]
