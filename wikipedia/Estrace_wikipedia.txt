Estradiol, or oestradiol, is a medication and naturally occurring steroid hormone.[7] It is an estrogen and is used mainly in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause,[7] hypogonadism, and transgender women. It is also used in hormonal contraception and sometimes in the treatment of hormone-sensitive cancers like prostate cancer. Estradiol can be taken by mouth, as a gel or patch that is applied to the skin, in through the vagina, by injection into muscle, or through the use of an implant that is placed into fat, among other routes.[7]
