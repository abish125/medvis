Red blood cells (RBCs), also called erythrocytes, are the most common type of blood cell and the vertebrate organism's principal means of delivering oxygen (O2) to the body tissuesâ€”via blood flow through the circulatory system.[1] RBCs take up oxygen in the lungs or gills and release it into tissues while squeezing through the body's capillaries.
