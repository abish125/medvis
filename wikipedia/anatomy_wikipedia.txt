Anatomy is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts.[1] Anatomy is inherently tied to embryology, comparative anatomy, evolutionary biology, and phylogeny,[2] as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated over immediate (embryology) and long (evolution) timescales. Human anatomy is one of the basic essential sciences of medicine.[3]
