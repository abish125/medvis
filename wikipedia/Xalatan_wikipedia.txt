Latanoprost eye solution is a medication administered into the eyes to control the progression of glaucoma or ocular hypertension by reducing intraocular pressure (IOP). It is a prostaglandin analogue (more specifically an analogue of prostaglandin F2Î±[1]) that lowers the pressure by increasing the outflow of aqueous fluid from the eyes through the uveoscleral tract.[2] Latanoprost is an isopropyl ester prodrug, meaning it is inactive until it is hydrolyzed by esterases in the cornea to the biologically active acid.[3]
