Ropinirole (INN; trade names Requip, Repreve, Ronirol, Adartrel) is a dopamine agonist of the non-ergoline class of medications. It is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Cipla, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories and Sun Pharmaceutical. It is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome (RLS). Ropinirole is one of three medications approved by the FDA to treat RLS, the other two being pramipexole (Mirapex) and gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant). The discovery of the drug's utility in RLS has been used as an example of successful drug repurposing.[2]
