Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food.[3]:1 Humans are omnivorous,[4][5][6] and have hunted and killed animals for meat since prehistoric times.[6] The advent of civilization allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, pigs and cattle, and eventually their use in meat production on an industrial scale.
