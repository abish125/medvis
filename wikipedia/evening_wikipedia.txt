Evening in its primary meaning is the period of the day between afternoon and night. Though the term is subjective, evening is typically understood to begin when the temperature has noticeably fallen and other accompanying weather changes have occurred, such as increased wind speed and change in cloud types and sky colour, and lasts until an hour or so after sunset, when maximum darkness has been reached.
