Buprenorphine/naloxone (trade name Suboxone) is a combination drug formulation of buprenorphine, a μ-opioid receptor (MOR) weak partial agonist and κ-opioid receptor antagonist, and naloxone, a MOR silent antagonist, in a 4:1 ratio.[1][2] It is used in the treatment of opioid dependence.[1][2] The purpose of naloxone is to deter intravenous abuse; parenteral administration rapidly induces opioid withdrawal symptoms, while regular, intended use does not (as naloxone is minimally bioavailable with sublingual ingestion).[1][2][3][4] The drug is intended to treat opioid dependence[1]
