Truly was an American rock band formed in the wake of the grunge era.[1] It featured singer-guitarist Robert Roth, bassist Hiro Yamamoto, and drummer Mark Pickerel.[1] Yamamoto and Pickerel were founding members respectively of Soundgarden and Screaming Trees. While not a commercially successful group like some of their Seattle contemporaries, the band lasted a decade with two studio albums to their name.
