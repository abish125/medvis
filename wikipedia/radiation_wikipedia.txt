In physics, radiation is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or through a material medium.[1][2] This includes electro-magnetic radiation such as radio waves, visible light, and x-rays, particle radiation such as α, β, and neutron radiation and acoustic radiation such as ultrasound, sound, and seismic waves. Radiation may also refer to the energy, waves, or particles being radiated.
