Hearing, auditory perception, or audition is the ability to perceive sound by detecting vibrations,[1] changes in the pressure of the surrounding medium through time, through an organ such as the ear. Sound may be heard through solid, liquid, or gaseous matter.[2] It is one of the traditional five senses; partial or total inability to hear is called hearing loss.
