Rhonchi are coarse rattling respiratory sounds somewhat like snoring, usually caused by secretions in bronchial airways. "Rhonchi" is the plural form of the singular word "rhonchus". Since the mid-1990s, it has no longer been considered appropriate terminology in auscultation of the thorax, as much confusion has been reported in the published literature which confuses this with crepitations and wheezes, so the exact nature of this term is unclear (see Fleischner Society for standardized terminology).[citation needed]
