Costochondritis, also known as chest wall pain, costosternal syndrome, or costosternal chondrodynia[1] is an acute[2] and often temporary inflammation of the costal cartilage, the structure that connects each rib to the sternum at the costosternal joint. The condition is a common cause of chest pain.[1][3][4] Though costochondritis often resolves on its own, it can be a recurring condition that has little or no signs of onset.[5]
