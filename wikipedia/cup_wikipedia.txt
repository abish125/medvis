A cup is a big, open container used for carrying and drinking drinks.[1][2] It may be made of wood, plastic, glass, clay, metal, stone, china or other materials,[3] and may have a stem, handles or other adornments. Cups are used for drinking across a wide range of cultures and social classes,[4] and different styles of cups may be used for different liquids or in different situations.[5]
