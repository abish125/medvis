It contains amlodipine, a dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blocker, and valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB or A2RA); typically formulated as the benzenesulfonate salt. Meta-analysis has shown this combination to be well tolerated and effective for the reduction of blood pressure.[1]
