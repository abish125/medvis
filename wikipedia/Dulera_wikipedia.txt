Mometasone/formoterol is a combination inhaler containing both an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting bronchodilator. It is indicated for the maintenance treatment of asthma in adults and children 12 years of age and older whose asthma is not well controlled on low- or medium-dose corticosteroids, or whose disease clearly warrants combination therapy. It is not approved for the treatment of acute bronchospasm.[1] To relieve acute symptoms, a rapid-onset short-duration inhaled bronchodilator (such as salbutamol) should be available to the patient for use.[2]
