Tramadol, sold under the brandname Ultram among others,[2] is an opioid pain medication used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain.[1] When taken as an immediate-release oral formulation, the onset of pain relief usually occurs within about an hour.[6] It has two different mechanisms. First, it binds to the Î¼-opioid receptor. Second, it inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.[7][8]
