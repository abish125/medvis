Gabapentin (GPN) marketed under the brand name Neurontin among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy, neuropathic pain, hot flashes, and restless leg syndrome.[4][5] In epilepsy it may be used for those with partial seizures.[4] It is recommended as one of a number of first line medications for the treatment of neuropathic pain in diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, and central neuropathic pain.[6] A 2014 review of its use for diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia found about 14% of people have a meaningful benefit.[7]
