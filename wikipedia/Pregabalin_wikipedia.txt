Pregabalin, marketed under the brand name Lyrica among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and generalized anxiety disorder.[9][10][11] Its use for epilepsy is as an add-on therapy for partial seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults.[12] Some off-label uses of pregabalin include restless leg syndrome,[13] prevention of migraines,[14] social anxiety disorder,[14] and alcohol withdrawal.[15] When used before surgery it does not appear to affect pain after surgery but may decrease the use of opioids.[16]
