Ibuprofen is a medication in the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) class that is used for treating pain, fever, and inflammation.[4] This includes painful menstrual periods, migraines, and rheumatoid arthritis.[4] About 60% of people improve with any given NSAID, and it is recommended that if one does not work then another should be tried.[5] It may also be used to close a patent ductus arteriosus in a premature baby. It can be used by mouth or intravenously. It typically begins working within an hour.[4]
