Chest XRay portable (date and time would be here and the radiologist who read the xray)
Impression:Impression: Mild cardiomegaly. No acute pulmonary disease.

EKG: Ischemic changes present

Assessment and Plan:

Problem List:
1. NSTEMI (non-ST elevated myocardial infarction)
   Impression/Plan
pt had chest pain and shortness of breath.
troponin: 1.23 and ischemic changes on ekg.
No longer symptomatic on the floor. 
beta blocker
oxygen 
aspirin
heparin started in ED
appreciate cards recommendations (reconsider cath in morning)
future echo

 3. Anemia
   Impression/Plan
likely due to anemia of chronic disease
trend crits for possible drop
[]iron studies 

 4.HTN
   Status Chronic
   Impression/Plan
continue home meds, but replace atenolol with carvedilol for nstemi

 5. Diabetes
   Impression/Plan
correction insulin and maintenance glargine 13 u, hold metformin
