Alprazolam, available under the trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting anxiolytic of the benzodiazepine class. It is commonly used for the treatment of anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder.[4][5] It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010.[6] Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, and amnestic properties.[7] Alprazolam is available for oral administration in compressed tablet (CT) and extended-release capsule (XR) formulations.
