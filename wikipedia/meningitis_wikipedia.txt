Meningitis (from Greek μῆνιγξ méninx, "membrane"[1] and the medical suffix -itis, "inflammation") is an acute inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the meninges.[2] The inflammation may be caused by infection with viruses, bacteria, or other microorganisms, and less commonly by certain drugs.[3] Meningitis can be life-threatening because of the inflammation's proximity to the brain and spinal cord; therefore, the condition is classified as a medical emergency.[2][4]
