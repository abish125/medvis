In physics, heat is energy in transfer other than as work or by transfer of matter. When there is a suitable physical pathway, heat flows from a hotter body to a colder one.[1][2][3][4][5][6] It results in a net increase in entropy. The pathway can be direct, as in conduction and radiation, or indirect, as in convective circulation.[7][8][9] Heat refers to a process of transfer, not to a property of a system.
