Word Origin and History for stomach Expand




n. 

c.1300, "internal pouch into which food is digested," from Old French estomac, from Latin stomachus "stomach, throat," also "pride, inclination, indignation" (which were thought to have their origin in that organ), from Greek stomachos "throat, gullet, esophagus," literally "mouth, opening," from stoma "mouth" (see stoma). Applied to the openings of various internal organs, especially the stomach, then to the stomach itself. Some 16c. anatomists tried to correct the sense back to "esophagus" and introduce ventricle for what we call the stomach. Meaning "belly, midriff, part of the body that contains the stomach" is from late 14c. Figurative senses in Latin extended into Middle English (cf. "relish, inclination, desire," 1510s). Stomach ache is from 1763.


v. 

"to tolerate, put up with," 1570s, from stomach (n.), probably in reference to digestion; earlier sense was opposite: "to be offended at, resent" (1520s), from Latin stomachari "to be resentful," from stomachus (n.) in its secondary sense of "pride, indignation." Related: Stomached; stomaching.

stomach definitionAn organ in the digestive system, on the left side of the body behind the lower rib cage, that receives chewed food from the esophagus. Tiny glands in the stomach's lining secrete gastric juice, which contains acids, mucus, and enzymes. This fluid, along with the muscular churning actions of the stomach, helps transform food into a thick, semifluid mass that can be passed into the small intestine for digestion.
