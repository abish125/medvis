Tylenol /ˈtaɪlənɒl/ is an American brand of drugs advertised for reducing pain, reducing fever, and relieving the symptoms of allergies, cold, cough headache, and influenza. The active ingredient of its original flagship product is paracetamol, an analgesic and antipyretic; it is commonly known in North America as acetaminophen, and elsewhere in the world by its international nonproprietary name, paracetamol. Like the words acetaminophen and paracetamol, the brand name Tylenol is derived from the chemical name for the compound, N-aceTYL-para-aminophENOL (APAP).[1] The brand name is owned by McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.[2]
