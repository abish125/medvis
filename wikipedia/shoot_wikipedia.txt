In botany, shoots consist of stems including their appendages, the leaves and lateral buds, flowering stems and flower buds.[1][2] The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a shoot where leaves will develop. In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem and/or flower growth that grows on woody plants.
