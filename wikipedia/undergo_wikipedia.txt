Operation Undergo was the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division's operation to take the fortified French port of Calais in September 1944. A subsidiary operation was executed to silence and capture the heavy batteries at Cap Gris Nez, which threatened the sea approaches to Boulogne.[1][2] The operation was part of the Allied effort to capture the Channel ports, following the breakout from Normandy.
