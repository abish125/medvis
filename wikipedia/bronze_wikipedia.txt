Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper and the addition of other metals (usually tin) and sometimes arsenic, phosphorus, aluminium, manganese, and silicon. These additions produces an alloy much harder than copper alone. The historical period where the archeological record contains many bronze artifacts is known as the Bronze Age.
