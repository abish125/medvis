Imatinib, sold under the brand names Gleevec and Glivec, is a medication used in the treatment of multiple cancers, most notably Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).[1] Due in large part to the development of Gleevec and related drugs having a similar mechanism of action, the five year survival rate for people with chronic myeloid leukemia nearly doubled from 31% in 1993 (before Gleevec's 2001 FDA approval) to 59% for those diagnosed between 2003 and 2009.[2] Median survival for imatinib-treated people with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) is nearly 5 years compared to 9 to 20 months in the pre-imatinib-era.[3]
