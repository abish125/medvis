Linezolid is an antibiotic used for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics.[1][2] Linezolid is active against most Gram-positive bacteria that cause disease, including streptococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).[3] The main uses are infections of the skin and pneumonia although it may be used for a variety of other infections including drug resistant tuberculosis.[2][4] It is used either by injection into a vein or by mouth.[2]
