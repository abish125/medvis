A sidewalk (American English) footpath or footway and pavement in Australian, New Zealand and Irish English, and pavement in British English is a path along the side of a road. A sidewalk may accommodate moderate changes in grade (height) and is normally separated from the vehicular section by a curb. There may also be a road verge (a strip of vegetation, grass or bushes or trees or a combination of these, referred to as either a verge or a nature strip in Australia, and as an island in parts of the United States) either between sidewalk and the roadway (British English: carriageway) or between the sidewalk and the boundary.
