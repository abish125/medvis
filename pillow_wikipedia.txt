A pillow is a cushioned support for the head or other parts of the body, usually used while sleeping on a bed, or for the body as used on a couch or chair.[1] Pillows consist of a fabric envelope which contains a soft stuffing, which may range from down feathers to synthetic foam. Bed pillows are typically covered with a cloth pillowcase. Pillows used in a living room typically have a sturdy cloth cover.
