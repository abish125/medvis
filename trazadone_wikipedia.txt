It is a phenylpiperazine compound. Trazodone also has antianxiety (anxiolytic) and sleep-inducing (hypnotic) effects.[2] Its side-effect profile and potential toxicity are considerably different from those of the original antidepressants (i.e., the monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs] and tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]).[3]
