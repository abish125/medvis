Paint is any liquid, liquefiable, or mastic composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film. It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture to objects. Paint can be made or purchased in many colorsâ€”and in many different types, such as watercolor, synthetic, etc. Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but dries into a solid.
