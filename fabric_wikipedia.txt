A textile[1] or cloth[2] is a flexible woven material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibres often referred to as thread or yarn. Yarn is produced by raw fibres of wool, flax, cotton, spinning or other material to produce long strands.[3] Textiles are formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting, or pressing fibres together (felt).
