An album is a recording originally issued in gramophone format, followed by the vinyl format, and has then been issued in other formats such as Compact Cassette, Compact disc, and increasingly in digital formats such as MP3, AAC, ALAC, or FLAC. Audio albums in physical form are often provided with decorative covers (cover art) and liner notes and inserts about the music and recording, giving background information and analysis of the recording, lyrics and librettos, images of the performers, and other images and text, as well as thanking contributors.[1] When supplied with compact discs they are known as CD booklets.[2]
