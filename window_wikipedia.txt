A window is an opening in a wall, door, roof or vehicle that allows the passage of light and, if not closed or sealed, air and sound.[1] Modern windows are usually glazed or covered in some other transparent or translucent material. Windows are held in place by frames.[2] Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather.[3] Windows often have a latch or similar mechanism to lock the window shut.
