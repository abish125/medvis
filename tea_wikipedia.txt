Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to Asia.[3] After water, it is the most widely consumed beverage in the world.[4] Some teas, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour, [5] while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes.
