The workplace is the physical location where someone works. Such a place can range from a home office to a large office building or factory. The workplace is one of the most important social spaces other than the home, constituting "a central concept for several entities: the worker and his/her family, the employing organization, the customers of the organization, and the society as a whole".[1] The development of new communication technologies have led to the development of the virtual workplace, a workplace that is not located in any one physical space.
