A particle is a minute fragment or quantity of matter.[1] In the physical sciences, the word is used to describe a small localized object to which can be ascribed several physical or chemical properties such as volume or mass; subatomic particles such as protons or neutrons; and other elementary particles.[2] This article deals mainly with the first of these; subatomic and elementary particles, the subject matter of particle physics, are dealt with in other articles.
