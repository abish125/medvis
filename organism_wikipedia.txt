In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as a vertebrate, insect, plant or bacterium. Although more than 99 percent of all species of organisms that ever lived on the planet are estimated to be extinct,[1][2] there are currently 10â€“14 million species of life on Earth.[3] All known types of organism are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and self-regulation (homeostasis).
