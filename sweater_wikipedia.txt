A sweater (American English) is a knitted garment intended to cover the torso and arms;[1] either a pullover or a cardigan, distinguished in that cardigans open at the front while pullovers do not. In British English, a pullover may also be called a jumper or jersey, and there is no hypernym equivalent to sweater covering both pullovers and cardigans. Sweaters are worn by adults and children of both sexes; often over a shirt, blouse, T-shirt, or other top, but sometimes next to the skin. Sweaters were traditionally made from wool, but can now be made of cotton, synthetic fibers, or any combination thereof. Sweaters are maintained by washing or dry cleaning, and the use of a lint roller or pill razor.
