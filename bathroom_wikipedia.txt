A bathroom is a room for personal hygiene, generally containing a bathtub or a shower, and possibly also a bidet. In North America and some other regions, it characteristically contains a toilet and a sink; hence in North American English the word "bathroom" is commonly used to mean any room containing a toilet, even a public toilet (although in the United States this is more commonly called a restroom). In other countries, including the UK, Australia, France and Japan, homes may have a separate toilet. In Iran almost all homes have two distinct rooms for bathroom and toilet room.
