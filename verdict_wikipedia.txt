In law, a verdict is the formal finding of fact made by a jury on matters or questions submitted to the jury by a judge.[1] The term, from the Latin veredictum, literally means "to say the truth" and is derived from Middle English verdit, from Anglo-Norman: a compound of ver ("true," from the Latin vērus) and dit ("speech," from the Latin dictum, the neuter past participle of dīcere, to say).
