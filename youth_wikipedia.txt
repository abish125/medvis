Youth is the time of life when one is young, but often means the time between childhood and adulthood (maturity).[1][2] It is also defined as "the appearance, freshness, vigor, spirit, etc., characteristic of one who is young".[3] Its definitions of a specific age range varies, as youth is not defined chronologically as a stage that can be tied to specific age ranges; nor can its end point be linked to specific activities, such as taking unpaid work or having sexual relations.[4] An individual's actual maturity may not correspond to their chronological age, as immature individuals can exist at all ages.
