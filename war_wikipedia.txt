War is a state of armed conflict between autonomous organizations (such as states and non-state actors) or coalitions of such organizations. It is generally characterized by extreme collective aggression, destruction, and usually high mortality. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as warfare. An absence of war is usually called peace.
