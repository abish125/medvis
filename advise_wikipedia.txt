ADVISE (Analysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight, and Semantic Enhancement) is a research and development program within the United States Department of Homeland Security Threat and Vulnerability Testing and Assessment (TVTA) portfolio. It is reported to be developing a massive data mining system, which would collect and analyze data on everyone in the United States and perform a "threat analysis" of them.[1] The data can be everything from financial records, phone records, emails, blog entries, website searches, and any other electronic information that can be put into a computer system.[2] The information is then analyzed, and used to monitor social threats such as community-forming, terrorism, political organizing, or crime.
