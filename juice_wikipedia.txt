Juice is a liquid that is naturally contained in fruit and vegetables. It can also refer to liquids that are flavored with these or other biological food sources such as meat and seafood. It is commonly consumed as a beverage or used as an ingredient or flavoring in foods. It is also a common practice to mix juices of different fruits/vegetables. Juice did not emerge as a popular beverage choice until the development of pasteurization methods allowed for the preservation of juice without fermentation.[1] The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimated the total world production of citrus fruit juices to be 12840318 tonnes in 2012.[2]
