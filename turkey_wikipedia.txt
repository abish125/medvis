Turkey (i/ˈtɜr.ki/; Turkish: Türkiye [tyrkije]), officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye Cumhuriyeti [tyrkije d͡ʒumhurijeti] ( listen)), is a contiguous transcontinental parliamentary republic largely located in Western Asia with the portion of Eastern Thrace in Southeastern Europe. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Bulgaria to the northwest; Greece to the west; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Iran and the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Mediterranean Sea is to the south; the Aegean Sea to the west; and the Black Sea to the north. The Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles (which together form the Turkish Straits) demarcate the boundary between Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia.[5] Turkey's location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia makes it a country of significant geostrategic importance.[6]
