A statute is a formal written enactment of a legislative authority that governs a state, city or country.[1] Typically, statutes command or prohibit something, or declare policy.[1] Statutes are laws made by legislative bodies and distinguished from case law which is decided by courts, and regulations issued by government agencies.[1] Statutes are sometimes referred to as legislation or "black letter law." As a source of law, statutes are considered primary authority (as opposed to secondary authority).
