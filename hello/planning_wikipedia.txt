Planning (also called forethought) is the process of thinking about and organizing the activities required to achieve a desired goal. It involves the creation and maintenance of a plan, such as psychological aspects that require conceptual skills. There are even a couple of tests to measure someoneâ€™s capability of planning well. As such, planning is a fundamental property of intelligent behavior.
