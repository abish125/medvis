Latin (i/ˈlætɪn/; Latin: lingua latīna, IPA: [ˈlɪŋɡʷa laˈtiːna]) is a classical language originally spoken in Latium, a part of Italy. Along with the extinct languages Oscan, Umbrian, and Faliscan, it belongs to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages.[3] It was written in the Latin alphabet, a writing system derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. Through the power of Roman Republic and Empire, Latin became the dominant language in Italy and was spread throughout Europe. Non-standard Latin dialects (Vulgar Latin) developed into the Romance languages, such as Italian, Spanish, and French. Latin and French have contributed many words to English, and Latin and Greek roots are used in biology and medicine.
