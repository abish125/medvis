Israelis (Hebrew: ישראלים Yiśraʾelim, Arabic: الإسرائيليين‎ al-ʾIsrāʾīliyyin), are citizens or nationals of the modern state of Israel, which is a multiethnic society that is home to people of different national backgrounds. The largest ethnic groups comprise Jews (see Jewish ethnic divisions) followed by Arabs (see Arabic-speaking minorities) and other minorities. However, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have a mixed heritage of at least two ethnic groups, due to cross-cultural intermarriage.
