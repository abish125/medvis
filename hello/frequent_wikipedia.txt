In grammar, a frequentative form (abbreviated freq. or fr.) of a word is one which indicates repeated action. The frequentative form can be considered a separate, but not completely independent word, called a frequentative. The frequentative is no longer productive in English, but in some languages, such as Finno-Ugric languages (Finnish or Hungarian), Balto-Slavic (Lithuanian or Russian and Polish), Turkic etc., it is.
