Gastroenteritis or infectious diarrhea is a medical condition from inflammation ("-itis") of the gastrointestinal tract that involves both the stomach ("gastro"-) and the small intestine ("entero"-). It causes some combination of diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and cramping.[1] Dehydration may occur as a result. Gastroenteritis has been referred to as gastro, stomach bug, and stomach virus. Although unrelated to influenza, it has also been called stomach flu and gastric flu.
