In medical parlance, swelling, turgescence or tumefaction is a transient abnormal enlargement of a body part or area not caused by proliferation of cells.[1] It is caused by accumulation of fluid in tissues.[2] It can occur throughout the body (generalized), or a specific part or organ can be affected (localized).[2]
