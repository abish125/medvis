Broadcasting is the distribution of audio and/or video content to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model.[1] Broadcasting began with AM radio broadcasting which sprang up spontaneously around 1920. Before this, all forms of electronic communication, radio, telephone, and telegraph, were "one-to-one", with the message intended for a single recipient. The term "broadcasting", borrowed from from the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about,[2] was coined by either KDKA manager Frank Conrad or RCA historian George Clark[3] around 1920 to distinguish this new activity of "one-to-many" communication; a single radio station transmitting to multiple listeners.
