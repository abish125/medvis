Parking is the act of stopping and disengaging a vehicle and leaving it unoccupied. Parking on one or both sides of a road is often permitted, though sometimes with restrictions. Parking facilities are constructed in combination with some buildings,[citation needed] to facilitate the coming and going of the buildings' users.Every country has it own rule to design parking space.
