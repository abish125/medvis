Phenylephrine is a selective Î±1-adrenergic receptor agonist of the phenethylamine class used primarily as a decongestant, as an agent to dilate the pupil, and to increase blood pressure. Phenylephrine is marketed as an alternative for the decongestant pseudoephedrine, though clinical studies suggest that phenylephrine is less effective than pseudoephedrine and not more effective than placebo.[1][2] Phenylephrine can also cause a decrease in heart rate through reflex bradycardia.[3]
