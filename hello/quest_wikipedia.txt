In mythology and literature, a quest, a journey towards a goal, serves as a plot device and (frequently) as a symbol.[1] Quests appear in the folklore of every nation[2] and also figure prominently in non-national cultures. In literature, the objects of quests require great exertion on the part of the hero, and the overcoming of many obstacles, typically including much travel. The aspect of travel also allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrator, not of the character).[3]
