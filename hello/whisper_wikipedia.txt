Whispering is an unvoiced mode of phonation in which the vocal folds (also known as vocal cords) do not vibrate normally but are instead adducted sufficiently to create audible turbulence (a 'hissing' quality) as the speaker exhales (or occasionally inhales) during speech.[1] This is a somewhat greater adduction than that found in breathy voice. Articulation remains the same as in normal speech.
