Fertilisation or fertilization (also known as conception, fecundation and syngamy) is the fusion of gametes to initiate the development of a new individual organism.[1] In animals, the process involves the fusion of an ovum with a sperm, which eventually leads to the development of an embryo. Depending on the animal species, the process can occur within the body of the female in internal fertilisation, or outside (external fertilisation). The cycle of fertilisation and development of new individuals is called sexual reproduction.
