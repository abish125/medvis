A sea is a large body of water that is part of surrounding waters or is surrounded in whole or in part by land.[1] More broadly, the sea (with the definite article, also called the World Ocean) is the interconnected system of the Earth's salty, oceanic waters, including the IHO's four named oceans[2]—the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic—and the waters of the Southern Ocean, either considered separately or included within the other four.[3] The sea moderates the Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been travelled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s.[4] The sea is conventionally divided into four or five large sections, such as the Pacific, called oceans while smaller sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as seas.
