Brown is the color of dark wood or rich soil.[1] It is a composite color; in printing or painting, it is made by combining red, black and yellow,[2][3] or red, yellow and blue.[4] In the RGB color model used to make colors on television screens and computer monitors, it is made by combining red and green, in specific proportions. The color is seen widely in nature, in wood, soil, and human hair color, eye color and skin pigmentation. In Europe and the United States, it is the color most often associated with plainness, humility, the rustic, and poverty. It is also, according to public opinion surveys in Europe and the United States, the least favorite color of the public.[5]
