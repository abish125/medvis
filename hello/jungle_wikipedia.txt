A jungle is land covered with dense vegetation dominated by trees. Application of the term has varied greatly during the last several centuries. Jungles in Western literature often represent a less civilised or unruly space outside the control of civilisation. Some attribute this to the jungle's association in colonial discourse with places that were colonised by Europeans[citation needed].
