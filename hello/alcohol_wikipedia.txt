In chemistry, an alcohol is any organic compound in which the hydroxyl functional group (-O H) is bound to a saturated carbon atom.[2] The term alcohol originally referred to the primary alcohol ethyl alcohol (ethanol), the predominant alcohol in alcoholic beverages. Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi first discovered alcohol (ethanol) in its pure form in Persia.
