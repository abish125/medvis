A building is a man-made structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a house or factory.[1] Buildings come in a variety of shapes, sizes and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, to land prices, ground conditions, specific uses and aesthetic reasons.
