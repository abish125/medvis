Pregnancy, also known as gravidity or gestation, is the time during which one or more offspring develops inside a woman.[1] A multiple pregnancy involves more than one offspring, such as with twins.[2] Pregnancy can occur by sexual intercourse or assisted reproductive technology. It usually last around 40 weeks (10 lunar months) from the last menstrual period (LMP) and ends in childbirth.[1][3] This is about 38 weeks after conception. An embryo is the developing offspring during the first 8 weeks following conception after which the term fetus is used until birth.[3] Symptom of early pregnancy may include a missed periods, tender breasts, nausea and vomiting, hunger, and frequent urination.[4] Pregnancy may be confirmed with a pregnancy test.[5]
