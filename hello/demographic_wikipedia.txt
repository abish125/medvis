Demography involves the statistical study of human populations. As a very general science, it can analyze any kind of dynamic living population, i.e., one that changes over time or space (see population dynamics). It encompasses the study of the size, structure, and distribution of these populations, and spatial and/or temporal changes in them in response to time, birth, migration, aging, and death.
