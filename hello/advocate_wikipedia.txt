An advocate is a type of professional person in several different legal systems and it is also a commonly used honorific for remarkable lawyers, such as in "Adv. Benedetto Marcello". [1] The broad equivalent in many English law-based jurisdictions can be a barrister. However, in Scottish, South African, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Scandinavian, South Asian and South American jurisdictions, advocate is also a word to indicate lawyers of superior classification.[2]
