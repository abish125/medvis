Nudity or nakedness is the state of wearing no clothing.[1] Wearing of clothing is a predominantly human characteristic arising from functional needs such as protection from the elements, from cold and heat, after the loss of body hair and migration to colder regions.[2] The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations, such as a need for warmth or protection from the elements, and social considerations. In some circumstances, a minimum amount of clothing or none at all may be considered socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing may be expected. Social considerations involve issues of modesty, decency and social norms, besides other considerations, and these may depend on the context. There may also be legal considerations.
