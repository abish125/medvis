Saint Devota (French: Sainte DÃ©vote; died ca. 303 AD) is the patron saint of Corsica and Monaco. She was killed during the persecutions of Diocletian and Maximian. She is sometimes identified with another Corsican saint named Julia, who was described in Latin as Deo devota ("devoted to God"). The description was misinterpreted as a proper name.[1] The legend connected with her is similar to those told of other saints of the region, such as Saint Reparata[2] and Saint Torpes.
