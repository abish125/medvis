Yaws (also known as frambesia tropica, thymosis, polypapilloma tropicum, parangi, bouba, framb√∂sie,[1] and pian[2]) is a tropical infection of the skin, bones and joints caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum pertenue.[3][4] The disease begins with a round, hard swelling of the skin, 2 to 5 centimeters in diameter.[4] The center may break open and form an ulcer.[4] This initial skin lesion typically heals after three to six months.[5] After weeks to years, joints and bones may become painful, fatigue may develop, and new skin lesions may appear.[4] The skin of the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet may become thick and break open.[5] The bones (especially those of the nose) may become misshapen.[5] After five years or more large areas of skin death with subsequent scarring may occur.[4]
