AdvancED is a non-profit, non-governmental organization that accredits primary and secondary schools throughout the United States and internationally.[1] AdvancED was formed in 2006 by the consolidation of the pre-college divisions of two of the U.S. regional accreditation organizations: the Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA CASI), and the Council on Accreditation and School Improvement of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS CASI).[1] In 2012 the Northwest Accreditation Commission (NWAC) joined AdvancED.[2]
