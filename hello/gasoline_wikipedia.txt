Gasoline /ˈɡæsəliːn/, known as petrol /ˈpɛtrəl/ outside of North America, is a transparent, petroleum-derived liquid that is used primarily as a fuel in internal combustion engines. It consists mostly of organic compounds obtained by the fractional distillation of petroleum, enhanced with a variety of additives; a 42-gallon barrel of crude oil yields about 19 gallons of gasoline, when processed in an oil refinery.
