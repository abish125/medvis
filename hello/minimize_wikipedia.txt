In mathematics, the maximum and minimum (plural: maxima and minima) of a function, known collectively as extrema (singular: extremum), are the largest and smallest value that the function takes at a point either within a given neighborhood (local or relative extremum) or on the function domain in its entirety (global or absolute extremum).[1][2][3] Pierre de Fermat was one of the first mathematicians to propose a general technique (called adequality) for finding maxima and minima.
