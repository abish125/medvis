Amyloidosis is a rare disease that results from accumulation of inappropriately folded proteins. These misfolded proteins are called amyloids. When proteins that are normally soluble in water fold to become amyloids, they become insoluble and deposit in organs or tissues, disrupting normal function.[2][3] The type of protein that is misfolded and the organ or tissue in which the misfolded proteins are deposited determines the clinical manifestations of amyloidosis.
