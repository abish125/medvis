Nausea (Latin nausea, from Greek ναυσία - nausia,[1] "ναυτία" - nautia, motion sickness", "feeling sick or queasy"[2]) is a sensation of unease and discomfort in the upper stomach with an involuntary urge to vomit.[3] It occasionally precedes vomiting. A person can suffer nausea without vomiting. (Greek ναῦς - naus, "ship"; ναυσία started as meaning "seasickness".)
