A basement or cellar is one or more floors of a building that are either completely or partially below the ground floor. Basements are typically used as a utility space for a building where such items as the boiler, water heater, breaker panel or fuse box, car park, and air-conditioning system are located; so also are amenities such as the electrical distribution system, and cable television distribution point. However in cities with high property prices such as London, basements are often fitted out to a high standard and used as living space.
