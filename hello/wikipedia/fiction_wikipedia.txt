Fiction is the classification for any creative informational work—almost always a narrative—whose creator does not claim responsibility for the work's faithfulness to reality;[1] in other words, any informative account not guaranteed to present only actual people, factual descriptions, or historically accurate events. Conversely, if the creator accepts responsibility for the truthfulness of a work, it is labelled nonfiction if his/her intention is honest and fraud if dishonest.[1] Although the term fiction has traditionally referred to works of literature in particular, such as novels and short stories, it may also refer to works of theatre (including opera and ballet), film, television, poetry, song, and play. In broader, everyday usage, fiction refers to any appearance, impression, or understanding that is imaginary or otherwise not strictly true.
