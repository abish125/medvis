Invisibility is the state of an object that cannot be seen. An object in this state is said to be invisible (literally, "not visible"). The term is often used in fantasy/science fiction, where objects are literally made unseeable by magical or technological means; however, its effects can also be demonstrated in the real world, particularly in physics and perceptual psychology classes.
