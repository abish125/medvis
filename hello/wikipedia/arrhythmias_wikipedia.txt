Cardiac arrhythmia (also known as irregular heartbeat) is any of a group of conditions in which the electrical activity of the heart is irregular, faster, or slower than normal.[1] The heartbeat may in fact be too fast or too slow, or may follow an irregular rhythm. A heart beat that is too fast - by convention above 100 beats per minute in human adults - is called tachycardia, and a heart beat that is too slow - conventionally below 60 beats per minute - is called bradycardia. Although many arrhythmias are not life-threatening, some can cause serious impairment of the cardiac function, up to the extreme of a cardiac arrest.[2]
