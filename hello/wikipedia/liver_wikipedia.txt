The liver is a vital organ of vertebrates and some other animals. In the human it is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, below the diaphragm. The liver has a wide range of functions, including detoxification of various metabolites, protein synthesis, and the production of biochemicals necessary for digestion. There is currently no way to compensate for the absence of liver function in the long term, although liver dialysis techniques can be used in the short term.
