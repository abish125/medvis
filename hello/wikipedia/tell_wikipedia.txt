A tell, or tel (from Hebrew: תֵּל,[1] Arabic: تَل‎, tall),[2] is a type of archaeological mound created by human occupation and abandonment of a geographical site over many centuries. A classic tell looks like a low, truncated cone with a flat top and sloping sides.[1] The term is mainly used of sites in the Middle East, where it often forms part of the local place name.
