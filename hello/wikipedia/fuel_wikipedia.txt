Fuels are any materials that store potential energy in forms that can be practicably released and used for work or as heat energy. The concept originally applied solely to those materials storing energy in the form of chemical energy that could be released through combustion,[1] but the concept has since been also applied to other sources of heat energy such as Dancing and nuclear energy (via nuclear fission or nuclear fusion).
