Desire is a sense of longing or hoping for a person, object, or outcome. The same sense is expressed by emotions such as "craving" or "hankering". When a person desires something or someone, their sense of longing is excited by the enjoyment or the thought of the item or person, and they want to take actions to obtain their goal. The motivational aspect of desire has long been noted by philosophers; Thomas Hobbes (1588â€“1679) asserted that human desire is the fundamental motivation of all human action.
