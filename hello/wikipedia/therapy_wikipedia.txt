Therapy (often abbreviated tx or Tx) is the attempted remediation of a health problem, usually following a diagnosis. In the medical field, it is usually synonymous with treatment (also abbreviated tx). Among psychologists and other mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, and clinical social workers, the term may refer specifically to psychotherapy or talking therapies. The English word therapy comes via Latin therapīa from Greek: θεραπεία and literally means "curing" or "healing".[1]
