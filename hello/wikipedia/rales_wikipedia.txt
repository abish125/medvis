Crackles, crepitations, or rales (i/ˈrɑːls/ RAHLS or /ˈræls/ RALS) are the clicking, rattling, or crackling noises that may be made by one or both lungs of a human with a respiratory disease during inhalation. They are often heard only with a stethoscope ("on auscultation"). Bilateral crackles refers to the presence of crackles in both lungs.
