A practitioner is someone who is qualified or registered to practice a particular occupation, profession, or religion. Practitioners who specialise in a particular area may be referred to as a specialist or advanced practitioner. The medical and social care professions use these titles to distinguish the level of qualifications, competency, and training a practitioner undertakes.
