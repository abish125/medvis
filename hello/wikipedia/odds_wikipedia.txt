Odds are a numerical expression, always consisting of a pair of numbers, used in both gambling and statistics. In statistics, odds for reflect the likelihood that a particular event will take place. Odds against reflect the likelihood that a particular event will not take place. The usages of the term among statisticians and probabilists on the one hand, versus in the gambling world on the other hand, are not consistent with each other (with the exception of horse racing).[1][2] Conventionally, gambling odds are expressed in the form "X to Y", where X and Y are numbers, and it is implied that the odds are odds against the event on which the gambler is considering wagering. In both gambling and statistics, the 'odds' are a numerical expression of how likely some possible future event is.
