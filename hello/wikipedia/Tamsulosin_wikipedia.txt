Tamsulosin (rINN) (/tæmˈsuːlɵsɨn/ or /tæmsʉˈloʊsɨn/) is used in the treatment of difficult urination, a common symptom of enlarged prostate. Tamsulosin, and other medications in the class called alpha blockers, work by relaxing bladder neck muscles and muscle fibers in the prostate itself and make it easier to urinate.[1]
