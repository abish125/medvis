A couch or sofa is a piece of furniture for seating two or more people in the form of a bench, with or without armrests, that is partially or entirely upholstered, and often fitted with springs and tailored cushions.[1][2] Although a couch is used primarily for seating, it may be used for reclining and napping.[3]
