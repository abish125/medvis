A sock is an item of clothing worn on the feet. The foot is among the heaviest producers of sweat in the body, as it can produce over 0.25 US pints (0.12Â l) of perspiration per day.[1] Socks help to absorb this sweat and draw it to areas where air can evaporate the perspiration. In cold environments, socks decrease the risk of frostbite.
