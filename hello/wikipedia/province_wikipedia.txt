A province is a territorial unit, almost always an administrative division, within a country or state. The term derives from the ancient Roman provincia, which was the largest territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside of Italy. The word "province" in modern English has its origins in the term used by the Romans. England declared the largest administrative divisions in its colonial empire to be provinces, including most of the thirteen colonies that later rebelled, renamed themselves states, and formed the federation known as the United States of America. The British colonies in North America that remained colonial provinces subdivided, multiplied, and eventually formed the confederation of provinces that now make up Canada. The difference between "province" and "state" in the former British Empire is now largely academic because Canada is no longer a colony of Britain and its 10 provinces have approximately the same jurisdictional responsibilities and powers as the 50 US states. Australia followed a similar path to independence as Canada, but its united colonies branded themselves "states".
