			INTRODUCTION — In most patients requiring mechanical ventilation, both lungs are inflated and deflated together. One lung ventilation (OLV) refers to mechanical separation of the two lungs to allow ventilation of only one lung, while the other lung is compressed by the surgeon or allowed to passively deflate. OLV is a standard approach to facilitate surgical exposure for pulmonary and other thoracic surgeries, or may be used to isolate a pathologic from a healthy lung to prevent soiling or to allow differential ventilation.This topic will discuss the general principles and physiology of OLV, its management, and complications. Devices used for OLV, their placement and comparative performance are reviewed separately. (See "Lung isolation techniques".)INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS — One lung ventilation (OLV) is used either to improve exposure to the surgical field in thoracic surgery, or to anatomically isolate one lung from a pathologic process of the other lung. Contraindications to OLV include dependence on bilateral mechanical ventilation, and intraluminal airway masses that restrict access to the tracheobronchial tree.IndicationsSurgical exposure — An immobile, collapsed lung in the vicinity of the surgical field improves access to the thoracic cavity, thus OLV is used during many thoracic surgical procedures:Pulmonary resection, including pneumonectomy, lobectomy, and wedge resectionVideo-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), including wedge resection, biopsy, and pleurodesisMinimally invasive cardiac surgeryThoracic vascular surgeryMediastinal surgeryThoracic spine surgeryEsophageal surgeryLung isolation — Lung isolation may be required to:Decrease pressure or air flow on the side of pathology, as in bronchopleural fistula or unilateral cyst/bullaeAvoid cross contamination from one lung to the other, as in pulmonary hemorrhage, purulent pulmonary secretions, or whole lung lavage for pulmonary alveolar proteinosisContraindications — Placement of double lumen endotracheal tubes (DLTs) may not be technically possible in patients with luminal airway masses which obstruct passage through the airway or are at risk of being dislodged [1]. Patients with severe pulmonary disease or prior pulmonary resection may not tolerate OLV; in these cases, selective lobar blockade may be an option. (See "Lung isolation techniques", section on 'Quality of lung deflation'.)PHYSIOLOGY — The clinician using one lung ventilation (OLV) needs to understand the changes in physiology caused by differential ventilation of the two lungs. During normal ventilation, ventilation and perfusion are well matched anatomically, because dependent portions of the lungs receive both greater blood flow (a result of gravity) and greater ventilation (from gravitational effects on lung compliance). The initiation of OLV stops all ventilation to one lung, which would create a 50 percent right to left shunt and relative hypoxemia if perfusion were unchanged. However, the actual shunt fraction is usually only 20 to 30 percent for the following reasons [2]:Surgical manipulation of the atelectatic lung obstructs vascular flow to the non-ventilated lungLateral positioning of the patient leads to a gravitational increase in perfusion to the dependent, ventilated lungHypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) modulates the blood flow to hypoxic regions of the lungsHPV reduces shunt flow through the nonventilated lung by 40 to 50 percent during OLV, moderating the degree of hypoxemia [3,4]. Alveolar hypoxia triggers the pulmonary vessels to constrict, directing blood away from poorly/nonventilated areas to better ventilated segments, thereby improving ventilation/perfusion matching. Clinically, HPV is proportional to the degree of local hypoxia, and is triggered primarily in response to an alveolar oxygen partial pressure (PAO2) less than 100 mmHg [4]. The onset of HPV is two-phase with an initial rapid onset phase (minutes) and a delayed phase (hours). HPV off-set follows a reverse two-phase pattern and may not completely return to normal for several hours [3]. This is an important consideration in the case of bilateral sequential thoracic procedures, such as bilateral wedge resections for lung metastases, in which patients tend to desaturate more during the OLV of the second lung.A number of anesthetic factors may influence the extent of HPV, some of which may be controlled by the management of the anesthetic.HPV is potentiated (causing less shunt, improving oxygenation) by [4]:Metabolic and respiratory acidosisHypercapniaMild decreased mixed venous oxygenationHyperthermiaHPV is decreased (causing increased shunt, worsening oxygenation) by:Metabolic and respiratory alkalosisHypocapniaHypothermiaIncreased left atrial pressureInhalation anesthetic over one minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)HemodilutionVENTILATION STRATEGIES — Thoracic surgery with one lung ventilation (OLV) can result in a spectrum of lung injury from the mild (acute lung injury [ALI]) to the severe (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]). (See "Ventilator-associated lung injury".) To minimize this risk, ventilation strategies are used during OLV that are adapted from approaches proven to be protective in the critical care setting for patients with ALI or ARDS. (See "Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome".)This protective ventilation strategy includes:Low tidal volume (TV) ventilation (below 6 to 8 mL/kg)Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP)Limited airway pressuresFraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) less than oneThe incidence of ALI following lung resection generally ranges from 2 to 4 percent [5-7], though it is higher after larger resections, particularly pneumonectomy at 8 to 12 percent [6,8]. Mortality with ALI is approximately 40 percent [4,9].Because of the low numbers involved, most studies of lung injury following mechanical ventilation rely on the measurement of cytokines or inflammatory markers as surrogates for pulmonary injury [10]. This is reasonable because in prospective studies of patients with ALI in critical care units, levels of inflammatory biomarkers have predicted mortality. (See "Inflammatory mechanisms of lung injury during mechanical ventilation", section on 'Clinical studies'.) The goal of protective ventilation is to minimize alveolar over-distension and cyclic atelectasis, which cause this inflammation, while maintaining adequate oxygenation.Low tidal volume — To minimize lung injury caused by high TVs, the standard of care at the authors’ institution is use of TV <6 mL/kg predicted body weight, based on its proven benefit in critical care patients with previous lung injury (see "Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome", section on 'Low tidal volume ventilation'), and some evidence of benefit in those without lung injury [11,12]. In addition, randomized trials of ventilation with lower TVs in patients undergoing OLV have demonstrated decreases in inflammatory markers, though not improved outcomes [13-15].Permissive hypercapnia — Use of low TVs without compensatory increases in respiratory rate leads to hypercapnia. This seems to be well-tolerated, and may be advantageous in OLV. Hypercapnia potentiates HPV [16] and causes a rightward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, enhancing oxygen delivery to tissue and thus potentially improving wound healing and reducing infectious complications [17]. However, benefits of hypercapnia must be balanced against the potential for increased intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension, myocardial depression, and decreased renal perfusion. (See "Permissive hypercapnia".)Hypercapnia (to 64 mmHg) during OLV was well tolerated in one trial, though associated with a 42 percent increase in pulmonary vascular resistance [18].In two other series with higher levels of hypercapnia, patients tended to require inotropic support [19,20].As a result of pre-existing pulmonary disease in this patient population, a large PaCO2 to end tidal CO2 gradient often exists during OLV, so regular arterial blood gas sampling is recommended.PEEP — During OLV, patients being ventilated with low TVs should have PEEP of 5 to 10 cm H2O applied. However the levels should be decreased or used with caution in patients with severe obstructive disease, in whom high levels of auto-PEEP make the impact of extrinsic PEEP unpredictable.PEEP is used during mechanical ventilation to prevent atelectasis and reduce injury from the mechanical stress of repetitive inflation/deflation cycles in the alveoli, which may lead to hypoxia and inflammation [21]. While there are no studies showing decreased lung injury associated with PEEP, equivalent or improved oxygenation and lower inflammatory markers resulted from use of PEEP (5 to 10 cm H2O) with low TV (5 to 7 mL/kg) during OLV when compared with larger TV (9 to 15 mL/kg) without PEEP in several trials [13,14,22]. When lower TVs are used, PEEP is considered standard to prevent atelectasis; the need is illustrated by a small study in which 10 cm H2O PEEP was required (in contrast to zero or 5 cm H2O PEEP) to maintain baseline oxygenation and functional residual capacity during upper abdominal surgery [23].Excessive PEEP during OLV may shift perfusion away from the ventilated lung, resulting in increased shunt [24,25].Auto PEEP in obstructive disease — When PEEP is added during OLV with higher TVs, or in patients with obstructive disease, the benefit is variable; this is most likely due to the contribution of dynamic hyperinflation, or auto-PEEP, in which incomplete expiration prior to the initiation of the next breath causes progressive air trapping. (See "Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)", section on 'Auto (intrinsic) PEEP'.)The majority of patients develop some level of auto-PEEP during OLV, at a level inversely correlated to the extent of obstructive pulmonary disease [26]. In patients with documented severe obstructive disease (low forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]), or those in whom the expiratory flow is interrupted by the next breath, even low PEEP should be used judiciously to avoid dynamic hyperinflation.In one trial, patients received either 10 cm H2O PEEP or no PEEP during OLV; PEEP improved oxygenation and lung compliance only in patients without obstructive disease [27].In a series of patients having OLV with 10 mL/kg TV, when PEEP 5 cm H2O was added, oxygenation improved in 14 percent, was unchanged in 65 percent, and worsened in 21 percent [28]. The patients most likely to benefit from PEEP in this study had normal spirometry and low levels of intrinsic PEEP; the addition of extrinsic PEEP to those with obstructive disease likely resulted in excessive alveolar distension, increased pulmonary vascular resistance within the ventilated lung, increased shunting of blood flow to the non-ventilated lung, and worsened hypoxia.Low airway pressures — Use of pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) rather than volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) during OLV has not been proven to decrease lung injury or improve oxygenation, but may be a reasonable choice to control high airway pressures and prevent barotrauma.Two crossover studies during OLV demonstrated improved oxygenation and shunt fraction with PCV as compared with VCV, especially in patients with poor preoperative lung function [29,30]. This may be because PCV provides a more homogeneous distribution of tidal volume, thus improving oxygenation and dead space ventilation [31].However, two other trials were unable to demonstrate any improvement in oxygenation, although they did have lower airway pressures with PCV [32,33].There are no prospective trials looking at outcome when ventilation is managed specifically to lower airway pressures. Two observational studies in patients undergoing OLV have associated ventilation at high airway pressures with the development of postoperative ALI, but it is unclear whether this is simply an early marker for lung injury rather than a causative effect [5,34]. Pulmonary barotrauma is associated with plateau airway pressures greater than 35 cm H2O, so maintaining plateau inspiratory pressures less than 30 cm H2O is a reasonable goal. (See "Pulmonary barotrauma during mechanical ventilation".)Oxygen concentration — Patients should be ventilated with the minimum FiO2 needed to maintain oxygen saturation above 90 percent for the following reasons:A high FiO2 allows absorption atelectasis in the ventilated lung, increasing shunt and worsening oxygenation [35].Hyperoxia produces toxic oxygen free radicals, though the threshold above which oxygen toxicity and ALI occur is unknown [36]. Re-expansion of the surgical lung worsens this oxidative stress, resulting in increased vascular permeability and alveolar-capillary membrane edema, so re-expansion using low FiO2 may attenuate this damage [37].Although use of 100 percent oxygen is often justified in order to minimize the risk of desaturation, the incidence of desaturation below 90 percent is only about 5 percent [2,38]. When lower concentrations are used, desaturation is apparent earlier, and oxygen levels may be increased while measures are taken to remedy the cause of the problem (most often device malposition) without needing to resort to two lung ventilation which interrupts the surgical procedure. (See 'Treatment of hypoxemia' below.)Protective ventilation — Protective ventilation, incorporating all of these parameters (smaller TVs, PEEP, lower airway pressures, FiO2 less than one), has demonstrated improved clinical outcomes when compared to previously advocated strategies:A randomized trial of 100 patients scheduled for elective lobectomy demonstrated a decreased incidence of pulmonary dysfunction (incidence of PaO2/FiO2 less than 300 mmHg, lung infiltrates, or atelectasis) with protective ventilation (TV 6 mL/kg, 5 cm H2O PEEP, FiO2 0.5, pressure-controlled ventilation) at 4 percent, compared with 22 percent with conventional ventilation (TV 10 mL/kg, no PEEP, FiO2 1.0, volume-controlled ventilation) [39].In a randomized trial of 52 esophagectomy patients, a protective management of OLV (TV 5 ml/kg with PEEP 5) resulted in lower inflammatory markers, higher pO2/FiO2 both during OLV and one hour postoperatively, and in a significant reduction of postoperative mechanical ventilation duration (115 versus 171 minutes) compared with a conventional ventilation strategy (TV 9 ml/kg) [13].An observational cohort study compared 1091 patients before and after implementation of a protective lung ventilation protocol consisting of small TVs (5.3 +/- 1.1 versus 7.1 +/- 1.2 mL/kg historically), limited maximal pressure ventilation, addition of PEEP, and recruitment maneuvers [40]. There was a decrease in ALI (from 3.7 to 0.9 percent), atelectasis (from 8.8 to 5.0 percent), admissions to the intensive care unit (from 9.4 to 2.5 percent), and length of hospital stay (from 14.5 +/- 3.3 to 11.8 +/- 4.1 days).MANAGEMENT OF HYPOXEMIA — The incidence of hypoxemia (oxygen saturation less than 90 percent) during one lung ventilation (OLV) is about 5 percent [2,38]. This is most commonly due to shunting; if severe hypoxemia occurs acutely, it should resolve with the resumption of bilateral ventilation. Because lung expansion may interrupt the surgical procedure, a series of other maneuvers are attempted first if the onset is more gradual (table 1).Predicting hypoxemia during OLV — Several factors predict increasing likelihood of hypoxemia during OLV [2,41,42]:Low pO2 prior to OLVLeft sided ventilation (due to smaller left lung)Higher (normal) FEV1 (see 'Auto PEEP in obstructive disease' above)Supine position as compared to lateral (see 'Physiology' above)Treatment of hypoxemia — We suggest the following approach to the management of hypoxemia during OLV (table 1):Initial treatment of hypoxemia is to increase the FiO2 to one. If this is not effective in bringing the oxygen saturation above 90 percent, temporarily return to two lung ventilation.Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) should be used to check the lung isolation device and reposition as needed. Tube malposition (often caused by changes in patient position or surgical manipulation) was responsible for 60 percent of hypoxic episodes during OLV in a large series [38]. (See "Lung isolation techniques", section on 'Placement of lung isolation devices'.)Occlusion of major bronchi by secretions or blood may be diagnosed and treated with FOB and suction.Cardiac output should be optimized. Many patients requiring OLV have poor cardio-respiratory reserve, and low cardiac output may result from hypovolemia, pump failure, or increases in pulmonary vascular resistance due to hypercapnia or auto-positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP).If hypoxemia persists, management of ventilation should be reassessed. We suggest attempting, in the following order:Recruitment maneuvers, short periods of higher airway pressures, and tidal volumes to re-expand atelectatic lung tissue, before, during, and after OLV, are effective in improving oxygenation, lowering shunt, and decreasing dead space [43-45]. However, recruitment maneuvers can cause lung injury in animal models, so their use must be weighed against the risks of atelectasis [46,47]. (See "Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome", section on 'Recruitment maneuvers'.)Adding 5 cm PEEP to the ventilated lung can be useful, but should be used with caution in patients with obstructive disease, who may have high levels of intrinsic PEEP [48,49]. (See 'PEEP' above.)Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 5 to 10 cm H2O to the nonventilated lung reduces shunt fraction by providing oxygen to the circulation of the nonventilated lung [50]. This is used only in response to hypoxemia, as any flow to the operative lung will cause partial inflation, potentially worsening surgical exposure. High frequency jet ventilation to the nonventilated lung has been used as an alternative to CPAP to improve oxygenation and decrease shunt [51]. A bronchial blocker or FOB may be used to insufflate oxygen/CPAP into only the nonoperative lobe(s) of the operative lung to treat hypoxemia [21].The nonventilated lung may be intermittently reinflated and ventilated, although this often requires interruption of the surgical procedure.Patients who do not tolerate collapse of an entire lung may tolerate collapse of the operative lobe. This can be achieved with a bronchial blocker placed in the bronchus of this lobe [52,53]. (See "Lung isolation techniques", section on 'Quality of lung deflation'.)The surgeon can decrease shunt by mechanically restricting pulmonary blood flow to the operative lung [54].Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) as a pulmonary vasodilator has been proposed to increase perfusion of the ventilated lung and thus minimize shunt, but it was ineffective in improving oxygenation in clinical trials [55-57].ANESTHETIC CHOICE — There is insufficient evidence that choice of anesthetic type (inhalational versus intravenous) affects oxygenation during one lung ventilation (OLV), or incidence of lung injury; therefore, the decision to use inhalation or intravenous anesthetics should be based on standard considerations unrelated to OLV [2]. Evidence of the impact of adding thoracic epidural to general anesthesia is contradictory in terms of effects on oxygenation and shunt during OLV, and should not impact the decision to use an epidural [58-61].Intravenous versus inhalation anesthetics — In a 2013 Cochrane review of 20 trials with 850 patients, there was no evidence that using intravenous versus inhalation agents to maintain anesthesia during OLV affected participant outcomes [62]. In most trials there were clinically insignificant differences in oxygenation or shunt fraction [63-67]; although in several trials inflammatory markers have differed, there is no good evidence that this translates to differences in clinically apparent lung injury [68-71]. The choice of maintenance anesthetic should be based on standard considerations. General versus combined thoracic epidural/general anesthesia — Trials of oxygenation during OLV under general anesthesia (intravenous and inhalation) with and without thoracic epidural anesthesia have reported contradictory results [58-61]. Given the low quality of evidence, and the lack of consistent results, the decision to use an epidural should be based on standard considerations.SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONSVentilation of a single lung while allowing the other to collapse is known as one lung ventilation (OLV). (See 'Introduction' above.)Indications for OLV include (see 'Indications' above):Surgical exposure during thoracic surgeryIsolation of one lung from the other for the treatment of pulmonary pathologyContraindications to OLV include dependence on bilateral mechanical ventilation, and intraluminal airway masses that restrict access to the tracheobronchial tree. (See 'Contraindications' above.)Physiologic changes caused by differential ventilation of the two lungs include ventilation/perfusion mismatch and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. (See 'Physiology' above.)During OLV, protective ventilation minimizes lung injury while maintaining oxygenation. We suggest using the following combination of ventilation strategies to the ventilated lung (Grade 2B) (see 'Ventilation strategies' above):Low tidal volume (TV) ventilation (below 6 to 8 mL/kg)Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) (5 to 10 cm H2O), except in patients with severe obstructive diseaseLimited airway pressures (plateau inspiratory pressures <30 cm H2O), or pressure-controlled ventilationFiO2 below one (as needed to maintain oxygen saturation >90 percent)To treat hypoxemia during OLV, we initially increase oxygen to 100 percent. If this is not effective, we temporarily return to two lung ventilation to bring the oxygen saturation above 90 percent, and then perform the following (see 'Treatment of hypoxemia' above):Check lung isolation device position using fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB), and reposition as indicatedSuction blood or secretions from major bronchiOptimize cardiac outputPerform recruitment maneuvers on the ventilated lungAdd 5 cm H2O PEEP to ventilated side (if not already applied); use with caution in patients with obstructive pulmonary diseaseAdd continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 5 to 10 cm H2O to the nonventilated lungThe nonventilated lung may be intermittently reinflated and ventilatedThe surgeon may consider clamping flow to the operative lungChoice of anesthetic type (inhalational versus intravenous, with or without epidural) does not have a significant clinical affect on oxygenation during OLV. We suggest choosing an anesthetic (inhalational versus intravenous, with or without epidural) based on standard considerations unrelated to OLV rather than modifying the choice because of planned OLV (Grade 2C). (See 'Anesthetic choice' above.)
