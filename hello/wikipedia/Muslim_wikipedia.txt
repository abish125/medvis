A Muslim, sometimes spelled Moslem,[1] relates to a person who follows the religion of Islam,[2] a monotheistic Abrahamic religion based on the Quran. Muslims consider the Quran to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. They also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad as recorded in traditional accounts called hadith.[3] "Muslim" is an Arabic word meaning "one who submits (to God)".[4] A female Muslim is sometimes called a "Muslimah". There are customs holding that a man and woman or teenager and adolescent above the age of fifteen of a lunar or solar calender who possesses the faculties of rationality, logic and/or sanity, but misses numerous successive Jumu'ahs without a valid excuse, no longer qualifies as a Muslim.[5][6]
