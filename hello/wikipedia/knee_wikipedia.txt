The knee joint joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two articulations: one between the femur and tibia, and one between the femur and patella.[1] It is the largest joint in the human body.[2] The knee is a mobile trocho-ginglymus (a pivotal condylar joint),[3] which permits flexion and extension as well as a slight internal and external rotation. The knee joint is vulnerable to both acute injury and the development of osteoarthritis.
