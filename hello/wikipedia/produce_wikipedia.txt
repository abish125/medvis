Produce is a generalized term for a group of farm-produced crops and goods, including fruits and vegetables (i.e. meats, grains, oats, etc. are sometimes considered produce.). More specifically, the term "produce" often implies that the products are fresh and generally in the same state as where they were harvested. In supermarkets the term is also used to refer to the section where fruit and vegetables are kept. Produce is the main product sold by greengrocers, farmers' markets, and fruit markets. The term "produce" is commonly used in the U.S. but is not typically used outside the agricultural sector in other English-speaking countries.
