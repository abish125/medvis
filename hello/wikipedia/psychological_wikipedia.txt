Psychology is the study of mind and behavior.[1][2] It is an academic discipline and an applied science which seeks to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.[3][4] In this field, a professional practitioner or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.
