A county, abbreviated Cnty. (US)[1][2] or Co. (UK),[3] is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes,[4] in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the Old French conté or cunté denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount.[5] The modern French is comté, and its equivalents in other languages are contea, contado, comtat, condado, Grafschaft, Gau, etc. (cf. conte, comte, conde, Graf).
