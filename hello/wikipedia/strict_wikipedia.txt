In mathematical writing, the adjective strict is used to modify technical terms which have multiple meanings. It indicates that the exclusive meaning of the term is to be understood. (More formally, one could say that this is the meaning which implies the other meanings.) The opposite is non-strict. This is often implicit but can be put explicitly for clarity. In some contexts the word "proper" is used as a mathematical synonym for "strict".
