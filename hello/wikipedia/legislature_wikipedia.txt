A legislature is a state's internal decision-making organization, usually associated with national government, that has the power to enact, amend, and repeal public policy. Legislatures observe and steer governing actions and usually have exclusive authority to amend the budget or budgets involved in the process. The most common names for national legislatures are "parliament" and "congress", although these terms have more specific meanings.
