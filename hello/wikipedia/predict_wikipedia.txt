A prediction (Latin pr√¶-, "before," and dicere, "to say") or forecast is a statement about the way things will happen in the future, often but not always based on experience or knowledge. While there is much overlap between prediction and forecast, a prediction may be a statement that some outcome is expected, while a forecast is more specific, and may cover a range of possible outcomes.[clarification needed][citation needed] A "prediction" may be contrasted with a "projection", which is explicitly dependent on stated assumptions.
