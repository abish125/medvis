A pension is a fixed sum to be paid regularly to a person, typically following retirement from service. There are many different types of pensions, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, as well as several others.[1] Pensions should not be confused with severance pay; the former is paid in regular installments, while the latter is paid in one lump sum.
