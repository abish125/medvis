Nature, in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the natural, physical, or material world or universe. "Nature" refers to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the cosmic. The systematic study of nature is science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.
