Twins are two offspring produced by the same pregnancy.[1] Twins can either be monozygotic ("identical"), meaning that they can develop from just one zygote that will then split and form two embryos, or dizygotic ("fraternal"), meaning that they can develop from two different eggs, each are fertilized by separate sperm cells.[2]
