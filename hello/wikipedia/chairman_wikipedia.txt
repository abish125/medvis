The chairman, sometimes known as the chairperson,[1] chairwoman (if female), or simply the chair,[2] is the highest officer of an organized group such as a board, a committee, or a deliberative assembly. The person holding the office is typically elected or appointed by the members of the group. The chair presides over meetings of the assembled group and conducts its business in an orderly fashion.[3] When the group is not in session, the officer's duties often include acting as its head, its representative to the outside world and its spokesperson.
