Income is the consumption and savings opportunity gained by an entity within a specified timeframe, which is generally expressed in monetary terms.[1] However, for households and individuals, "income is the sum of all the wages, salaries, profits, interests payments, rents and other forms of earnings received... in a given period of time."[2]
