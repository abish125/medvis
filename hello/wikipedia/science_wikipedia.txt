Science (from Latin scientia, meaning "knowledge"[2]) is a systematic exploration of phenomenal reality that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about nature. Scientific knowledge is built up methodically using experiments and observations, and resulting in proposed scientific facts, scientific models, or scientific theories.[nb 1] In an older and closely related meaning, "science" also refers to this body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied. Ever since classical antiquity, science as a type of knowledge has been closely linked to philosophy. In the West during the early modern period the words "science" and "philosophy of nature" were sometimes used interchangeably,[3]:p.3 and until the 19th century natural philosophy (which is today called "natural science") was considered a separate branch of philosophy.[4]
