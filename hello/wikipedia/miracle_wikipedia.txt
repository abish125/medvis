A miracle is an event not explicable by natural or scientific laws.[1] Such an event may be attributed to a supernatural being (God or gods), a miracle worker, a saint or a religious leader. Theologians say that, with divine providence, God(s) regularly work through created nature yet are free to work without, above, or against it as well.[2]
