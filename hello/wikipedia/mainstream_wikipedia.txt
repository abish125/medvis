Mainstream is the common current thought of the perceived majority.[1] It includes all popular culture and media culture, typically disseminated by mass media. The opposite of the mainstream are subcultures, countercultures and cult followings. It is often used as a pejorative term by subcultures who view ostensibly mainstream culture as not only exclusive but artistically and aesthetically inferior.[attribution needed] In the United States, mainline churches are sometimes referred to synonymously as "mainstream."[2][3]
