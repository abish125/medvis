The Moon (Latin: Luna) is Earth's only natural satellite.[e][f][8] Although not the largest natural satellite in the Solar System, among the satellites of major planets it is the largest relative to the size of the object it orbits (its primary).[g][h] It is the second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known (after Jupiter's satellite Io).
