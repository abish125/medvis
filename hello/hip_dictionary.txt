Word Origin and History for hip Expand




n. 

"part of the body where pelvis and thigh join," Old English hype "hip," from Proto-Germanic *hupiz (cf. Dutch heup, German Hüfte, Gothic hups "hip"), from PIE *qeub- "to bend." Hip of a roof is from late 17c.


"seed pod" (especially of wild rose), Old English heope, hiope "seed vessel of the wild rose," from Proto-Germanic *hiup- (cf. dialectal Norwegian hjupa, Old Saxon hiopo, Dutch joop, Old High German hiafo, dialectal German Hiefe, Old English hiopa "briar, bramble").


adj. 

"informed," 1904, apparently originally in black slang, probably a variant of hep (1), with which it is identical in sense, though it is recorded four years earlier.


interjection 

exclamation used to introduce a united cheer (cf. hip-hip-hurrah), 1827, earlier hep, cf. German hepp, to animals a cry to attack game, to mobs a cry to attack Jews (see hep (2)); perhaps a natural sound (cf. Latin eho, heus).

Encyclopedia Article for hip Expand





in anatomy, the joint between the thighbone (femur) and the pelvis; also the area adjacent to this joint. The hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint; the round head of the femur rests in a cavity (the acetabulum) that allows free rotation of the limb. Amphibians and reptiles have relatively weak pelvic girdles, and the femur extends horizontally. This does not permit efficient resistance to gravity, and the trunks of these animals often rest partially on the ground. In mammals the hip joint allows the femur to drop vertically, thus permitting the animal to hold itself off the ground and leading to specializations for running and leaping. See also pelvic girdle.
