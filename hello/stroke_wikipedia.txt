Stroke, also known as cerebrovascular accident (CVA), cerebrovascular insult (CVI), or brain attack, is when poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death. There are two main types: ischemic due to lack of blood flow and hemorrhagic due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly.[1] Symptoms may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of one vision to one side among others.[2][3] Symptoms usually but not always come on quickly. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA).[3] Hemorrhage strokes may also be associated with a severe headache.[3] The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent.[1] Long term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control.[3]
