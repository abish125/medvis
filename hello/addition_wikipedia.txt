Addition (often signified by the plus symbol "+") is one of the four elementary, mathematical operations of arithmetic; with the others being subtraction, multiplication and division. The addition of two whole numbers is the total amount of those quantities combined. For example, in the picture on the right, there is a combination of three apples and two apples together; making a total of 5 apples. This observation is equivalent to the mathematical expression "3 + 2 = 5" i.e. "3 add 2 is equal to 5".
