In architecture, a hall is a relatively large space enclosed by a roof and walls.[1] In the Iron Age, a mead hall was such a simple building and was the residence of a lord and his retainers. Later, rooms were partitioned from it, so that today the hall of a house is the space inside the front door through which the rooms are reached. Where the hall inside the front door of a house is elongated, it may be called a passage, corridor, or hallway.
