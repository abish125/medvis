Tramadol (marketed as Ultram, and as generics) is an opioid pain medication used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain.[4] When taken as an immediate-release oral formulation, the onset of pain relief usually occurs within about an hour.[5] It has two different mechanisms. First, it binds to the Î¼-opioid receptor. Second, it inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.[6][7]
