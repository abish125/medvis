Moral, ethical, legal, and political discussions use the concept of dignity to express the idea that a being has an innate right to be valued and to receive ethical treatment. In the modern context dignity can function as an extension of the Enlightenment-era concepts of inherent, inalienable rights. English-speakers often use the word "dignity" in proscriptive and cautionary ways: for example in politics it is usually[citation needed] used to critique the treatment of oppressed and vulnerable groups and peoples, but it has also been applied to cultures and sub-cultures, to religious beliefs and ideals, to animals used for food or research, and to plants. "Dignity" also has descriptive meanings pertaining to human worth, although there is no exact or agreed-upon definition of this worth. In general, the term has various functions and meanings depending on how the term is used and on the context.
