Sir is an honorific address used in a number of situations in many anglophone cultures. The term can be used as a formal prefix, especially in the Commonwealth, for males who have been given certain honors or titles (such as knights and baronets), where usage is strictly governed by law and custom. It may also be used informally towards a male of superior rank or status, such as an educator, or as a form of address from a merchant to a customer.
