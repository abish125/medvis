Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP, also known as anaphylactoid purpura,[1] purpura rheumatica,[1] and Schönlein–Henoch purpura)[1] is a disease of the skin and other organs that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small hemorrhages); often with joint and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, there may be a loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine, but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small proportion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.
