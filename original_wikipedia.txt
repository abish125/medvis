Originality is the aspect of created or invented works by as being new or novel, and thus can be distinguished from reproductions, clones, forgeries, or derivative works.[citation needed] An original work is one not received from others nor one copied from or based upon the work of others.[citation needed]. It is a work created with a unique style and substance. The term "originality" is often applied as a compliment to the creativity of artists, writers, and thinkers.[citation needed] The idea of originality as we[who?] know it was invented by Romanticism,[1] with a notion that is often called romantic originality.[2][3][4]
