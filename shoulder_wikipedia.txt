The human shoulder is made up of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone) as well as associated muscles, ligaments and tendons. The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints. "Shoulder joint" typically refers to the glenohumeral joint, which is the major joint of the "shoulder," but can more broadly include the acromioclavicular joint. In human anatomy, the shoulder joint comprises the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula, the head sitting in the glenoid fossa[disambiguation needed].[1] The shoulder is the group of structures in the region of the joint.[2]
