A civilian under the laws of war (also known as international humanitarian law) is a person who is not a member of his or her country's armed forces or militias or who is not taking a direct part of hostilities in an armed conflict. Civilians are distinct from combatants. They are considered non-combatants and are afforded a degree of legal protection from the effects of combat and military occupation. In U.S. parlance, a civilian is also considered one not on active duty in the armed services, not a law enforcement officer, or not a firefighter.[1] In a military context, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to law enforcement officers as civilians, even with the militarization of police.[2]
