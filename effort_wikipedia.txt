In physics, energy is a property of objects, transferable among them via fundamental interactions, which can be converted into different forms but not created or destroyed. The joule is the SI unit of energy, based on the amount transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.[1]
