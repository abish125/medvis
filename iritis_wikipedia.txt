Uveitis is, broadly, inflammation of the uvea. The uvea consists of the middle, pigmented vascular structures of the eye and includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Uveitis requires an urgent referral and thorough examination by an optometrist or ophthalmologist and urgent treatment to control the inflammation. Prior to the twentieth century, uveitis was typically referred to in English as "ophthalmia."[1]
