Psychotherapy is therapy for a person's mental or emotional problems (psycho-, mind, + -therapy), typically by conversing with another person (talk therapy). This other person may be a psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, clinical social worker, member of the clergy, alternative practitioner, or (to use the concept in its broadest sense) any helpful person. With successful psychotherapy, a client changes in a positive way, resolving or mitigating troublesome behaviors, beliefs, compulsions, thought, or emotions. Ideally, these are replaced with more pleasant and functional alternatives.
