Indeed.com is an employment-related metasearch engine for job listings launched in November 2004.[2] As a single-topic search engine, it is also an example of vertical search. Indeed is currently available in over 50 countries and 28 languages. In 2010, Indeed surpassed Monster.com to become the most visited job site in the United States.[3] Indeed.com is one of the most trafficated employment websites in the United States as ranked by Alexa (see the Alexa ranking in the infobox to the right, as compared to other employment websites). In October 2010, Indeed.com slipped past Monster.com to become the largest job site in the United States.[4][5] A provider of rankings of the amount of unique viewers per month—comScore Inc—in January 2013, ranks Indeed.com first.[6] As of March 2014, Indeed reaches over 140 million unique visitors every month.[7]
