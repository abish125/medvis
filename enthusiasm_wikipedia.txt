Enthusiasm is intense enjoyment, interest or approval. The word originally referred to inspiration or possession by a divine afflatus or by the presence of a god, and Johnson's Dictionary, the first comprehensive dictionary of the English language, defines enthusiasm as "a vain belief of private revelation; a vain confidence of divine favour or communication."
